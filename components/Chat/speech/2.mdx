<Question>
  A react component that is constantly listening if the user
  says a word from a list
</Question>

<Answer writing>

To build a React component that listens for specific words spoken by the user, we'll need to use the Web Speech API, specifically the SpeechRecognition interface.

First, let's create a simple React component called _`VoiceListener`_ that will contain our speech recognition logic. At this point, it only renders a title.

```jsx voice.jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"

class VoiceListener extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Voice Listener</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default VoiceListener
```
