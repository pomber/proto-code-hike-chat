<Question>
  A react component that is constantly listening if the user
  says a word from a list
</Question>

<Answer>

To build a React component that listens for specific words spoken by the user, we'll need to use the Web Speech API, specifically the SpeechRecognition interface.

First, let's create a simple React component called _`VoiceListener`_ that will contain our speech recognition logic. At this point, it only renders a title.

</Answer>

```jsx voice.jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"

class VoiceListener extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Voice Listener</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default VoiceListener
```

<Answer writing>

We'll first check if the browser supports the SpeechRecognition API and initialize the SpeechRecognition object.

The _`componentDidMount`_ lifecycle method ensures that the API is initialized when the component is mounted.

Please review this part and let me know if there are any issues or questions.

```jsx voice.jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"

class VoiceListener extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    if (
      "SpeechRecognition" in window ||
      "webkitSpeechRecognition" in window
    ) {
      const SpeechRecognition =
        window.SpeechRecognition ||
        window.webkitSpeechRecognition
      this.recognition = new SpeechRecognition()
    } else {
      console.error(
        "Speech recognition not supported in this browser."
      )
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Voice Listener</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default VoiceListener
```
